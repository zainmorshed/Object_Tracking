Object Tracking and Recognition with YOLOv8

Project Overview: This computer vision project focuses on real-time object tracking and recognition in video streams. 
Leveraging the power of the YOLOv8 model from the Ultralytics library, the project seamlessly captures video frames, processes each frame through the YOLO object detection model,
and intelligently tracks objects using bounding boxes. The result is a dynamic and interactive system that can detect and identify objects within a video, providing valuable insights into visual data.



Technologies Used:
- Ultralytics Library
- YOLOv8 Object Detection Model
- OpenCV for Video Processing

​Results and Impact: The project successfully delivers real-time object tracking and recognition capabilities in videos. 
With bounding boxes highlighting detected objects, users can easily visualize and interpret the contents of a video stream. T
his project lays the foundation for applications in surveillance, automated monitoring, and various domains where understanding video content is essential.
